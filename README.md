# Joint survey and classification

In order to characterise simplified joint geometries that can be efficiently analysed in #TITAN an extensive database of spacecraft joints was produced. This is accomplished by identifying a set of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites that are likely to fragment upon re-entry, and finding types of joints that are present within these spacecraft. 

This database was generated through the project: _Fast Determination of Satellite Re-entry and Fragmentation_, by the University of Strathclyde, Imperial College London, and D-Orbit UK Ltd, and funded through the UK Space Agency National Space Technology Programme Space Surveillance and Tracking Call (Grant Reference NSTP-SST-007).
