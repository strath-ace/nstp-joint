# Joint survey and classification

In order to characterise joint geometries that can be efficiently analysed in #TITAN, an atmospheric re-entry anlaysis software developed by the University of Strathclyde, an extensive database of spacecraft joints was produced. This is accomplished by identifying a set of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites that are likely to fragment upon re-entry, and finding types of joints that are present within these spacecraft. 

This database was generated through the project: _Fast Determination of Satellite Re-entry and Fragmentation_, by the University of Strathclyde, Imperial College London, and D-Orbit UK Ltd, and funded through the UK Space Agency National Space Technology Programme Space Surveillance and Tracking Call (Grant Reference NSTP-SST-007).

The Joint Survey and Classification task was performed by D-Orbit using a proprietary open source search methodology with support from Imperial College London. The intent of this task is to identify and categorise a broad set of joints and related technologies which current/future satellites operating in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) region may utilise. Several COTS and low TRL joints were recorded to provide a representative set of joints for re-entry modelling and prediction.
